== 2. History of OOP

The first approach for Object Oriented Programming (OOP) was more than 40 years ago with the programming language Simula 67. However the first language to be really successful with this new approach in programming was Smalltalk. These languages fullfilled the basics needed for OOP. With a slow and steady development OOP became a more and more used concept in new developed programming languages <<KOP09>>.

Since the teaching of programming languages like Java took place in a wide range of university classes, OOP became more and more relevant to companies. This lies in the fact that graduates from all over the world tend to know how to use at least one OOP language. The fact that more and more companies made use of OOP languages in their software solutions pushed their popularity even further.

Nowadays OOP is the most spread concept between all programming languages. Besides their teaching all over the globe their popularity can be derived from the fact that problems from the real world can easily be transfered into the programming world. It is simple to imagine a button in a graphical interface to be an object with certain properties. Even non OOP languages nowadays tend to use object similar approaches as you can see with the programming language Go in Chapter <<5. Object Oriented Programming in Go>> <<KOP09>>. Sometimes this works out well, but the OOP approach turns out to be the better way in most of this cases.

== 3. Object Oriented Programming

As we learned in chapter <<2. History of OOP>>, OOP is a widely spread concept in modern programming languages. It takes proceedings from the real world into a programming context. This is because of the fact that you can declare every instance from the real world as an object. These objects on the other hand can be put in context and interact with each other. These traits of OOP are called classification and inheritance. With that in mind every object needs his own class with its own methods to interact with each other <<KOP09>>. In the following chapter we will learn how a class in OOP is structured and what base concepts OOP uses to set classes in context with each other and how they are visibile outside of the object. The extend to which a programming language uses these concepts defines how much of an OOP language it is.

=== 3.1 Classification

Classification is a technique used to classify objects due to their skills. During the process objects are structured (chapter <<3.3 Inheritance>>) and the skills are assigned to the objects class. 

A class describes and implements a new type of object. Objects in OOP are derived from that class. Every class consists of several attributes and methods. An object kann be created using the class as kind of a datatype with parameters. The added parameters are assigned to the attributes in the constructor of the class. The created object interacts independently from other objects with the environment using the methods provided by the base class.

The methods of a class are declared in an interface. This can be used by other classes to interact with the classes objects using these methods <<KOP09>>.

=== 3.2 Encapsulation

Encapsulation is used for hiding the objects information from the environent. It is uesd to protect the attributes values of the object from manipulation. This is done by declaring the attributes visibility. If an attribute is declared as not visible from outside the object it can only be accessed by using methods declared in the inteface of the objects class. Methods can also be declared in different visibility states depending on the programming language.

An encapsulated object can only be interacted with via the methods declared in the interface. Every attribute or method not mentioned in the interface is neither accessible nor visible from outside <<KOP09>>.

{empty} + 

=== 3.3 Inheritance

As in chapter <<3.1 Classification>> mentioned, Objects in OOP are structured by their skills and abilities. In OOP every Object is derived from a parent object. The resulting child object is able to use the functionality of the parent and its own.  This property is called inheritance. 

With the use of inheritance it is possible to reuse the previous defined structures or to make use of an abstract object which can be specified in the child object. This helps the programmer to reduce the complexitiy and effort of the programm.

Especially the use of an abstract class can be very useful. This is the case if a program uses different object that contain several equal attributes. In this case the abstract class defines the base attributes and the child objects inherit them and implement their functionality for them <<KOP09>>.

=== 3.4 Polymorphism

A synonym for polimorphism is diversity. Taking this into the context of programming languages, polymorphism is the approach to accept and return values of more than one datatype.

OOP uses this functionality with its inheritance (chapter <<3.3 Inheritance>>). This allows the use of different objects as parameters and/or return values.

{empty} + 

=== 3.5 Persistence

Persistence stands for the lifetime an object exists in the program after it is created. There are some different approaches depending on the used programming language. While in C++ the user is responsible for deleting the created objects after their use expired, languages like Java use a so called "garbage collector". 

Having this in mind, languages with a garbage collector are for no use in safety related software, because a fast reaction to a problem can not be guaranteeed if the garbage collector interrupts the programm at the exact moment of a emergency. An automatic memory management on the other hand is much less bug prone due to the lower complexity <<KOP09>>.

== 5. Object Oriented Programming in Go

The programming language Go was introduced by Google in 2009. It has been develoed since by a team at google and a lot of other contributors from the open source community. The BSD style license it was released with allowed the community the further development to this day .

Its initial cause was to create a language that is more accessible and save than C/C++ in terms of syntax, compile time and functionality. The focus was to develop an easier solution for scalable network services and cloud computing. 
Whilst Go differs in many ways from the C programming language, its roots with this language are preserved in the fact, that it still uses C like pointers. But they do not support pointer arithmetic which is because of the fact, that Go puts his focus on fast compiling <<GOL20>>.

Go does a balancing act between velocity and accessibility. Its purpose is to deliver a solution which is faster than competing languages like python <<WSP20>> and more accessible than the really fast languages C and C++. 
Sadly Go does not fit well with GUI development or the development of embedded systems <<COP20>>.  

In terms of OOP even Google is not sure whether or not Go is an OOP language. The total abscence of some features, which are discussed later in this chapter, could lead to the conclussion that Go simply is no OOP language. But at least it can be argued, that Go allows an OOP like style of programming <<IGO18>>. The degree to which Go differs from classic programming languages like C++ or Java will be discussed in the following chapters.

{empty} +

=== 5.1 Classification with Go

Go does not provide a classic syntax for creating a class. Go does not provide classes. To achive a classification Go uses structs similar to structs in the C programming language. The following code snipped shows how a class is implemented in Go.

.Example for a class in Go
[source,ruby,linenums]
----
# This is the struct containing the attributes of the class GeoObject
type GeoObject struct {
	color color.Color
	p     Position
}

# These are methods of class GeoObject
func (g GeoObject) Paint() {
	var s fmt.Stringer
	s = g
	fmt.Println(s.String())
}

func (g GeoObject) String() string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("GeoObject: color=%v, x=%v, y=%v", g.color, g.p.x, g.p.y)
}
----

This states out that a struct is a user defined type that can hold a list of attributes. In combination with functions using the struct as base, as shown in the snippet, Go is able to offer similar functionality than other languages using classes <<COP20>>. 

{empty} +

=== 5.2 Encapsulation with Go

Classic OOP languages use keywords like "protected", "private" and "public" to encapsulate attributes and methods of their classes. Go does offer a different approach. 

Go encapsulates on package level by differentiating between lower or upper case on the first letter of the method or struct name.

.Encapsulating possibilities in Go
[source,ruby,linenums]
----
# This is a public struct due to the capital letter
type GeoObject struct {}

#This is a private struct due to the lower case letter
type position struct { x, y float64 }

#This is a private method due ot the lower case letter
func (g *GeoObject) string() string {
    return fmt.Println("I can only be called inside my package")
}

# This is a public method due to the capital letter
func (g *GeoObject) Draw() { 
    fmt.Println("I can be called from outside my package")
}
----

As is seen in the above code snippet one can make some methods of a struct private and others public. Even structs can be declared private. This allows the base concept of encapsulation even if it is not as convenient like in other OOP languages as mentioned <<IGO18>>.

TIP: If you declare a method with a parameter in front of the method name you can conveniently call it like myStruct.myFunction(). The Go compiler anyway compiles it like a normal parameter after the function name. So this is just syntactic sugar which gives you the illusion to write and call a real OOP method.
